    <string name="text_dummy">"Somehow I can't believe there is a height that no one who knows the secret of making dreams come true. In my opinion, this secret can be summarized in four C's, namely curiosity (curiosity), confidence (confidence), courage (courage), and constancy (perseverance) with the most influential is confidence. When you believe something, trust it completely and don't have to question it anymore." - Walt Disney</string>
